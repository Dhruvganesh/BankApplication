# Bank Application

## Brief introduction
This project will try to reflect a bank application. The functions that can be done to your money in the bank account will be
available to use and implement. 

The target audience is for those who wish to learn how a bank application works without having the risk of working with their valued savings.

This project is of interest to me, as I have always had a keen interest in the finance world. I wish to be able to integrate Computer Science and Finance and learn more about both these fields
and work on developing a complex application by the end of all the phases.

# Phase 4: Task 3
**UML Diagram**
- EventLog uses a list of Events.
- GUI uses JsonReader and JsonWriter.
- BankServer uses a list of BankAccount's.
- BankAccount and BankServer implements Writable.
- GUI uses BankAccount and BankServer.

**Reflection**
- Through this project, I learned a lot about Java and BANK management systems and it was a great self learning experience.
- If I had more time, I would have made the GUI more aesthetic and added account to account transfers.
